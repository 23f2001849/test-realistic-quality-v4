# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
This is a professional weather dashboard designed with Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome icons. It displays the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions of a selected city in styled cards.

The dashboard also includes a city search input and a button to fetch the weather data. The results are displayed in a div with the id `weather-display`.

The design is modern and fully responsive, with a gradient background and professional styling and UX.

## Setup
1. Save the `index.html` file to your local machine or server.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the weather dashboard.

## Usage
1. Enter the name of the city in the input field labeled "Enter city name".
2. Click the "Fetch Weather" button to display the weather data for the city.
3. The weather data for the city will be displayed in a card format, showing the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

Note: This is a mockup and does not fetch real weather data. To use real weather data, replace the `fetchWeather` function in `index.html` with an actual API call.

## Improvements (if any)
This is the first version of the Weather Dashboard.
